## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have PHP installed on your system. You can download it from the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
- Install Composer, the PHP package manager. You can find installation instructions on the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- Install a database server like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and create a new database for your Laravel application.
- Set up a mail server or use a service like [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for testing email functionality.

## 1. Clone or Download The Project

If you already have a Laravel project, skip this step. Otherwise, download or clone a Laravel project from a version control repository or create a fresh Laravel project using Composer with the following command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-project-name
cd your-project-name
